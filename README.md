# LLMDataForge
LLMDataForge is a repository showcasing a collection of working examples for generating synthetic datasets tailored for large language models (LLMs). This repository aims to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts looking to create and utilize synthetic datasets for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating LLMs.
The focus is on providing working examples with minimum dependencies to make getting started easy. We provide examples that are good starting points, work locally with minimum hardware requirements but can be scaled if desired.
